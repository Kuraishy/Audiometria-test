 Audiometria
 Version 0.1
 
 Audiometry: hearing test, equal loudness contours (hearing thresholds), 
 sensitivity and acuity.
 
 Warning 1:
 Start with the master sound low!
    Loud sounds can hurt or damage your ears.
    I do not give any warranty nor take any responsibility about any bad usage
        of this software.
 
 
 Warning 2:
 This test does not, in any manner, substitute a doctor!
    This software is for informational purposes only.
    You can use to compare your left and right ears or to equalize your computer.
    The spectral purity and the sound level depend on your sound card and 
        headphones.
    Daily fluctuations in hearing are common.
    If you are worried about your listening, consult an audiologist.
